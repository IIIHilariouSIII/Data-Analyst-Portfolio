# Maksym Oleksiuk - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Maksym! I hold a degree in Systems Analysis and Control from the National Technical University of Ukraine 'Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.' My academic background has equipped me with a solid foundation in systems analysis, data management, and decision-making processes.

Throughout my studies, I developed strong analytical skills and a passion for leveraging data to drive insights and improve decision-making. My experience includes working with complex datasets, programming in various languages, and applying statistical methods to uncover trends and patterns.

I am eager to apply my technical and analytical skills to a data analyst role, where I can contribute to meaningful projects and continue to grow professionally. I am particularly interested in utilizing my expertise to solve real-world problems and drive data-informed decisions.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analysis of an apartment rental offers in Germany
**Code:** [`Analysis of an apartment rental offers in Germany`](https://github.com/IIIHilariouSIII/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Immo_analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** To understand the underlying factors that drive rental price variations in the housing market.

**Description:** The data was scraped from Immoscout24, the biggest real estate platform in Germany and loaded in Kaggle for public use. The dataset included regions, costs of electricity and internet, type of heating, internet speed, base and total rent price, types of flat and so on. In general there are 49 columns. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between all parameters, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that the most significant factors influencing rental prices are service charges, base rent, living space, and living space range.
