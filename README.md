# Maksym Oleksiuk - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Maksym! I hold a degree in Systems Analysis and Control from the National Technical University of Ukraine 'Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.' My academic background has equipped me with a solid foundation in systems analysis, data management, and decision-making processes.

Throughout my studies, I developed strong analytical skills and a passion for leveraging data to drive insights and improve decision-making. My experience includes working with complex datasets, programming in various languages, and applying statistical methods to uncover trends and patterns.

I am eager to apply my technical and analytical skills to a data analyst role, where I can contribute to meaningful projects and continue to grow professionally. I am particularly interested in utilizing my expertise to solve real-world problems and drive data-informed decisions.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analysis of an apartment rental offers in Germany
**Code:** [`Analysis of an apartment rental offers in Germany.ipynb`](https://github.com/IIIHilariouSIII/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Immo_analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** To understand the underlying factors that drive rental price variations in the housing market.

**Description:** The data was scraped from Immoscout24, the biggest real estate platform in Germany and loaded in Kaggle for public use. The dataset included regions, costs of electricity and internet, type of heating, internet speed, base and total rent price, types of flat and so on. In general there are 49 columns. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between all parameters, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that the most significant factors influencing rental prices are service charges, base rent, living space, and living space range.


### Analysis of laptops technical specifications
**Code:** [`Analysis of laptops technical specifications.ipynb`](https://github.com/IIIHilariouSIII/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/laptops_analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** The analysis aims to identify and understand how various technical specifications, such as RAM size, CPU and GPU manufacturers, and screen resolution, influence laptop market prices.

**Description:** The data was collected from a comprehensive dataset of laptop specifications and prices, which was made available on Kaggle for public analysis. The dataset includes various features such as manufacturer, model, screen size, CPU, GPU, RAM, memory, operating system, weight, and price. In general there are 15 columns. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between all parameters, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions, the analysis revealed that the most significant factors influencing laptop prices are RAM, screen resolution, and CPU type.

### Netflix Movies and TV Shows Data Analysis
**Code:** [`Netflix Movies and TV Shows Data Analysis.sql`](https://github.com/IIIHilariouSIII/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Netflix%20Movies%20and%20TV%20Shows%20Data%20Analysis.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Netflix shows, movies, and series, including details such as title, director, cast, country of origin, release year, rating, duration, and the date the content was added to the platform. It covers various types of content available globally on Netflix, categorized by genre and other attributes. This project includes the following steps: data loading and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions

**Technology:** PostgreSQL

### Sales and Customers Dashboard
**Link:** [`Sales and Customers Dashboard`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maksym.oleksiuk/viz/SalesCustomerDashboardsDynamic_17266703567640/SalesDashboard?publish=yes)

**Description:** The purpose of sales dashboard is to present an overview of the sales metrics and trends in order to analyze year-over-year sales performance and understand sales trends. The customer dashboard aims to provide an overview of customer data, trends and behaviors. It will help marketing teams and management to understand customer segments and improve customer satisfaction.

**Results:** KPI Overview, Sales Trends, Customer Trends, Product Subcategory Comparison, Weekly Trends for Sales & Profit, Customer Distribution by Number of Orders, Top 10 Customers By Profit.
